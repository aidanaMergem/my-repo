The GANTT Chart
A GANTT chart is a planning tool that depicts graphically the order in which various tasks must be completed and the duration of each activity.
The GANTT chart indicates:
•	the tasks to be performed;
•	who is responsible for each task; and
•	the time each task is expected to take.
